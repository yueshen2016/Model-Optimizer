## NeMo Evaluator Launcher Assistant

Guide the user through creating NEL YAML configs, running evaluations, and monitoring progress.

### Workspace integration

If `MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set, read `skills/common/workspace-management.md` and reuse existing workspaces (this skill is usually the final stage of PTQ → Deploy → Eval; carry any deployment-time patches into `deployment.command`).

### Workflow

```text
- [ ] Step 0: Check workspace (if MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT set)
- [ ] Step 1: Check `nel` install + existing config
- [ ] Step 2: Build base config (5-question flow OR shortcut)
- [ ] Step 3: Configure deployment (model path, params, cross-check)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill remaining ??? values
- [ ] Step 5: Confirm tasks (iterative)
- [ ] Step 6: Multi-node (if needed)
- [ ] Step 7: Interceptors (if needed)
- [ ] Step 7.5: Container auth (SLURM private images)
- [ ] Step 8: Dry-run → canary → full run
- [ ] Step 9: Verify completed run
```

---

### Step 1 — Prerequisites

Run `nel --version`; if missing, instruct `pip install nemo-evaluator-launcher`. If user has an existing config, skip to Step 8 (optionally review for `???` and quantization flags first).

**Task recipes** (always read before editing the relevant task in the config):

- AA Index v2 suite (default for quantized-checkpoint validation, see `references/quantization-benchmarks.md`): `recipes/tasks/aa/{gpqa_diamond,hle,lcr,scicode,ifbench,mmmu_pro,tau2_bench_telecom}.md`
- Optional: `recipes/tasks/mmlu_pro.md`, `recipes/tasks/aime_2025.md`, `recipes/tasks/livecodebench.md`

**AA rule:** If the user mentions "AA" / "Artificial Analysis", generate **only** tasks under `recipes/tasks/aa/`. Do not add MMLU-Pro, AIME 2025, or LiveCodeBench unless explicitly asked.

**Shortcut path** (when task list is known up front, e.g. "run AA"):

1. Read the task reference file(s).
2. Use `recipes/examples/example_eval.yaml` as the base.
3. Copy the YAML fragment(s) into `evaluation.tasks`, applying any per-task notes.
4. **MLflow auto-export is on by default** — it needs **two** pieces, both in `example_eval.yaml`: (a) the **trigger** `execution.auto_export.destinations: [mlflow]` (without it the run is *not* uploaded), and (b) the `export.mlflow` block that configures it. In the `export.mlflow` block use **literal** values for `experiment_name` / `description` / `tags` — substitute the actual `served_model_name` and sampling params. Do **not** use `${deployment.*}` / `${evaluation.*}` cross-references: with auto-export on, NEL resolves the export block at submit time in a scope without those nodes and fails with `Interpolation key '...' not found` (`${oc.env:USER}` is fine — it's an env var). Because these literals can't interpolate, keep the `temperature` / `top_p` / `max_new_tokens` tags **equal to** the top-level `params` and update both in the same edit — they're the only queryable record of sampling in MLflow (NEL doesn't log them as run params), so a stale tag silently misreports the run. Fill `tracking_uri` in Step 4.
5. Proceed to Step 3, then Step 4, then Step 7.5/8. Skip Step 2's 5-question flow.

---

### Step 2 — Build base config (when not using shortcut)

Ask the 5 questions via AskUserQuestion (categories must match `nel skills build-config --help` — **run that first** to confirm the current option names; CLI options override this list).

1. **Execution:** Local / SLURM
2. **Deployment:** None (External) / vLLM / SGLang / NIM / TRT-LLM. Prefer vLLM unless the user/card says otherwise.
3. **Auto-export:** None / MLflow / wandb
4. **Model type:** Base / Chat / Reasoning
5. **Benchmarks** (multi-select): standard / code / math_reasoning / safety / multilingual

Build the base:

```bash
nel skills build-config --execution <...> --deployment <...> --model_type <...> --benchmarks <...> [--export <...>] [--output <...>]
```

(`--output` omitted = cwd auto-named; directory = dir + auto-name; `*.yaml` = exact path. Never overwrites.)

---

### Step 3 — Configure deployment

**Model path.** Checkpoint path (`/`, `./`, `../`, `~`, or exists on disk) → set `deployment.checkpoint_path`, leave `hf_model_handle: null`. Else HF handle (one `/`, not on disk) → set `deployment.hf_model_handle`, leave `checkpoint_path: null`.

> **Prefer `checkpoint_path` over `hf_model_handle` on SLURM** — `hf_model_handle` isn't reliably mounted at `/checkpoint`, so the deploy dies with `HFValidationError`. To eval an un-staged HF model, stage it first (`huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`) and point `checkpoint_path` at it. See `example_eval.yaml` for why.

**Auto-detect ModelOpt quantization** (checkpoint paths). Check `config.json` for `quantization_config` (or legacy `hf_quant_config.json`):

- **vLLM:** no `--quantization` flag by default — vLLM auto-detects from `quantization_config` / `hf_quant_config.json`. Add only when the card, vLLM version, or dry-run error requires it.
- **SGLang:** may need `--quantization modelopt_fp8` / `modelopt_fp4` / `modelopt` — verify against installed version.

Some models need extra vLLM backend env vars (model-card research) — e.g. `VLLM_NVFP4_GEMM_BACKEND=marlin` (Nemotron Super), or `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4=1` + `VLLM_FLASHINFER_MOE_BACKEND=throughput` (NVFP4 MoE, e.g. NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-NVFP4). Put them in `deployment.env_vars` (**not** `command`) with the `lit:` prefix (`VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4: lit:1`); see `example_eval.yaml` and Step 5's prefix rule.

**Auto-detect from `config.json`:**

| Field | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| `max_position_embeddings` | `--max-model-len <value>` |
| `auto_map` exists | `--trust-remote-code` |

#### Cross-check both sources for vLLM (mandatory, neither replaces the other)

**Source 1 — `recipes.vllm.ai/<org>/<model>`** (curated vLLM recipes; authoritative for parallelism, family-specific flags like `--reasoning-parser` / `--tool-call-parser` / `--mm-encoder-tp-mode`, vLLM version, spec-decoding, GPU count). Pin variants via query params (e.g. `?variant=fp8&strategy=single_node_tep`).

> **WebFetch caveat — triage the summary:**
>
> 1. **"No `vllm serve` commands found" / "page is a usage guide":** JS-rendering miss. recipes.vllm.ai pages always have ≥1 command. Ask the user to paste it or share the variant URL.
> 2. **Single recipe returned** for a model with known multiple variants → retry with variant-pinned URL. Axis names differ per model (Qwen: `?variant=&strategy=`; Kimi: `?advanced=`; others vary — no fixed pattern).
> 3. **Variant label contradicts the command** (e.g. label "TEP" but command shows DP+EP) → summarizer conflated variants; ask user.
>
> For non-trivial deployments (≥120B, multi-node, novel arch), ask the user which variant *before* fetching.

**Source 2 — HF model card + `config.json`** (authoritative for):

| Signal | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| `max_position_embeddings` | `--max-model-len <value>` |
| `auto_map` | `--trust-remote-code` |
| Reasoning/CoT documented | `--reasoning-parser` (and `--reasoning-parser-plugin` if custom) |
| Tool-calling documented | `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser <parser>` |
| Custom flags in card | Add as specified (e.g. `--mamba_ssm_cache_dtype float32`) |

**Cross-check rules:**

1. Read both sources before composing the command.
2. Agree → use with confidence.
3. Disagree → **do not silently pick one.** Surface both values to the user. Common conflicts: stale cards, parser rename between generations (Qwen2.5 `hermes` → Qwen3 `qwen3_coder`), recipe-only flags like `--language-model-only`, ARM64-specific card notes.
4. Resolve in Step 3 — don't defer to dry-run.

#### vLLM deployment command structure — single `command:` field

Rewrite the build-config output into one `command:` field. Move all parallelism (`--tensor-parallel-size`, `--data-parallel-size`, `--pipeline-parallel-size`) into the command; do not keep separate `tensor_parallel_size` / `data_parallel_size` / `extra_args` YAML fields.

```yaml
deployment:
  command: >-
    vllm serve /checkpoint
    --host 0.0.0.0
    --port ${deployment.port}
    --tensor-parallel-size <N>
    --data-parallel-size <M>
    --max-model-len <value>
    <... rest of cross-checked flags ...>
```

Conventions: always start `vllm serve /checkpoint` (NEL mounts here); always `--served-model-name ${deployment.served_model_name}` (**required**; see `example_eval.yaml` for why); always `--host 0.0.0.0 --port ${deployment.port}`; use folded scalar (`>-`) for one flag per line. Example fallback `--max-model-len 131072` covers AA-LCR (~120K + 16K gen) and SciCode (≥ 65536) — prefer `config.json` / recipe value.

Backend env vars (e.g. `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4`) are not CLI flags — put them in `deployment.env_vars`, not this `command` (see Step 3).

For how to choose `--tensor-parallel-size` / `--data-parallel-size` / `--pipeline-parallel-size` (and EP) from the model size and your GPU count, read `references/parallelism.md` — cross-check the layout against `recipes.vllm.ai`, then adapt to the GPUs you actually have via the fit math there.

**Image / vLLM version.** Default `image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.19.1` (pinned for reproducibility). If `recipes.vllm.ai` states a higher minimum version for the chosen variant (e.g. "vLLM >= 0.20.0"), bump the image tag accordingly (e.g. `v0.20.0`) — do **not** stay on `0.19.1` when the recipe explicitly requires newer. Do **not** use `:latest` (drifts across re-runs, breaks reproducibility). The version is part of the cross-check: surface to the user when bumping.

> **NVFP4 on Blackwell B300/GB300 (sm_103): append `-cu130` to the image tag** (e.g. `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.19.1-cu130` — release tags are multi-arch). The default cu12 build has no sm_103 FP4 kernel, so engine init dies with `CUDA error: no kernel image is available`. If a pinned release predates the model's arch, use `cu130-nightly-<arch>` (Qwen3.5-9B's `qwen3_5` needed it, vLLM 0.19.2rc1.dev134). Multimodal on sm_103 may also need `--mm-encoder-attn-backend TRITON_ATTN`. Full note in `recipes/examples/example_eval.yaml`.

#### vLLM-backend defaults — always include unless the recipe *contradicts*

Silence is not contradiction. Drop/override only when the recipe sets a different value for the same setting (e.g. recipe pins `--max-num-batched-tokens 16384` → use 16384).

- `--max-num-batched-tokens 8192` — caps per-step batched tokens; prevents long-prefill stalls.
- `--enable-chunked-prefill` — interleaves long prefills with decode steps (required for AA-LCR's ~120K input). Modern vLLM defaults this on for many models; set explicitly to avoid drift.
- `--enable-expert-parallel` — **MoE-only default.** Detect MoE from handle suffix (`-A10B`, `-A3B`, etc.), `num_experts` / `num_local_experts` / `n_routed_experts` in `config.json`, or card. No-op when TP=DP=1, safe to always include for MoE. Do not add for dense models. See `references/parallelism.md` for what EP does and the DP-attention + EP-MoE throughput pattern.
- `--max-num-seqs N` — **omit at generation time** (top-level `parallelism` is `???`). Add this comment above `command:`:

  ```text
  # After filling in `parallelism` values (top-level + per-task overrides),
  # append `--max-num-seqs N` where N = ceil(max_parallelism / data_parallel_size).
  ```

  In Step 4 compute and append. Example: top-level=16, Tau2=128, DP=8 → `ceil(128/8)=16`. Too small → request queuing; too large → wasted KV reservation. For how to choose the `parallelism` it derives from, read `references/parallelism.md`.

#### Evaluation params template (top-level params)

The top-level `nemo_evaluator_config.config.params` must contain **exactly these six fields** — no `top_k` / `presence_penalty` / `repetition_penalty` / `min_p`:

```yaml
nemo_evaluator_config:
  config:
    params:
      parallelism: ???    # Required — size per references/parallelism.md (bounded by total request count vs GPU serving capacity); ask user in Step 4 if still unclear
      request_timeout: 3600
      max_retries: 10
      max_new_tokens: 65536  # see rule below
      temperature: 1.0    # from model card (reasoning); adjust
      top_p: 0.95         # from model card (reasoning); adjust
```

Per-task `max_new_tokens` overrides are forbidden — set one top-level ceiling everywhere.

#### `max_new_tokens` — mandatory model-card lookup

1. **Fetch the HF model card before writing the value.** Not optional.
2. Scan for any `max_tokens` / `max_new_tokens` / "output length" recommendation. Pick the **highest** value the card mentions (Qwen3.6: 32768 general + 81920 math-coding → use **81920**). Annotate with a citing comment.
3. If the card is genuinely silent after a thorough read, fall back to: **65536** (reasoning), **16384** (non-reasoning); surface the silence to the user.
4. **Forbidden:** writing `max_new_tokens: <generic_default>` with a "card not yet checked" comment. Either fetch and apply, or fetch and confirm silence.

#### Quantization-aware benchmark defaults

For quantized checkpoints, read `references/quantization-benchmarks.md` for sensitivity rankings and recommended sets; present and ask which to include. Read `references/model-card-research.md` for the full extraction checklist (sampling, reasoning config, ARM64, `pre_cmd`, output length — see the dedicated bullet there).

Reasoning models: prefer reasoning mode (highest scores). For lower variance / cost / apples-to-apples vs non-reasoning baselines, also consider a non-reasoning companion run.

#### Reasoning adapter config (`use_reasoning`)

The `adapter_config` block in `example_eval.yaml` controls request/response
logging and reasoning handling. `use_reasoning: true` strips the model's
reasoning/CoT trace before scoring (grade only the final answer). Set per type:

1. **Instruct → `use_reasoning: false`** and drop the `chat_template_kwargs`
   thinking block (no trace to strip; can mangle plain responses).
2. **Reasoning → `use_reasoning: true`**, especially when the deployment sets
   `--reasoning-parser` (vLLM emits a separate reasoning channel to strip).
3. **Hybrid (reasoning on *or* off) → turn it ON** (`use_reasoning: true` +
   force the thinking flag in `chat_template_kwargs`). For the exact toggle key
   (it drifts across generations) and the reasoning-effort policy, see
   `references/model-card-research.md` → "Reasoning config".

---

### Step 4 — Fill remaining ??? values

**Predefined per-cluster execution config (check FIRST).** Some installs ship `internal/slurm/<cluster>` execution groups (optional `nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal` pkg) that pre-fill hostname/partition/gres — leaving only account/output_dir/walltime. Discover at runtime (nothing cluster-specific hardcoded):

```bash
python3 -c 'import nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal' 2>/dev/null && \
PKG=$(python3 -c 'import nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal as m,os;print(os.path.dirname(m.__file__))') && \
for f in "$PKG"/configs/execution/internal/slurm/*.yaml; do \
  echo "$(basename "$f" .yaml) -> $(grep -E '^hostname:' "$f" | awk '{print $2}')"; done
```

Hostname match → set `defaults: - execution: internal/slurm/<cluster>`, drop the redundant `execution.hostname` (keep account/output_dir/walltime), verify with `--dry-run`. Else keep `slurm/default` and fill hostname/account/output_dir manually.

> **SLURM gotchas (invisible to `--dry-run`; surface at canary):**
>
> - **`mount_home: false`** — `true` mounts host `~/.cache`; a shared-fs symlink there dangles in-container → deploy dies `FileNotFoundError /root/.cache/huggingface`. Mount the real cache to `/hf-cache` + set `HF_HOME` instead.
> - **`cpu_partition: <cpu-partition>`** — **required for MLflow `auto_export` to work** on clusters with separate GPU/CPU partitions. If not specified, NEL runs the export (a CPU-only job) on the GPU partition — it does not auto-route — which gets rejected (`Cannot find GPU specification`) and fails the task despite `EVAL_EXIT_CODE=0`. Set to the CPU partition (e.g. `cpu`).
> - **Shared env vars** can go top-level `env_vars:` (merges into both stages) or per-stage as the example shows; `execution.env_vars` hard-errors. Stage-specific vars stay under `deployment`/`evaluation.env_vars`.
>
> ```yaml
> execution:
>   cpu_partition: <cpu-partition>
>   mounts:
>     mount_home: false
>     deployment: { <realpath ~/.cache/huggingface>: /hf-cache }   # ssh <host> realpath ~/.cache/huggingface
>     evaluation: { <realpath ~/.cache/huggingface>: /hf-cache }
> env_vars: { HF_TOKEN: host:HF_TOKEN, HF_HOME: lit:/hf-cache }   # both stages
> ```

- Find every `???` left. Ask the user only for what can't be inferred (SLURM hostname/account/output_dir, MLflow tracking URI, etc.). Don't propose defaults; let them give plain text.
- **`parallelism`** — size it yourself from the run shape (total requests = `dataset_size × repeats` vs GPU serving capacity), and set `--max-num-seqs` to match. Read `references/parallelism.md` for the decision rule and worked examples; only ask the user if a non-GPU cap (e.g. judge rate limit) is unknown.
- Ask about other defaults they may want to change (partition, walltime, MLflow tags).
- **`execution.gres`** — auto-set if you used a predefined `internal/slurm/<cluster>` config (above). On the `slurm/default` fallback it's `gpu:8`, so set it to the node's GPU count (and match `--data-parallel-size`/`--tensor-parallel-size`) or `sbatch` rejects the job with *"Requested node configuration is not available"* (e.g. 4-GPU GB300 → `gres: gpu:4`; check with `sinfo -o '%P %G'`).

**Walltime cap: 4 hours.** Always `execution.walltime: "04:00:00"`. The cluster does not schedule jobs longer than 4h — this is a hard limit, not a preference.

Evals that exceed 4h of wall-clock time are handled by **NEL's built-in dependency-chain resume**, not by shrinking the eval. NEL submits the first SLURM job; if it hits walltime, a dependent follow-on job resumes from the response/result caches the first job wrote, then queues another follow-on. Long evals continue across walltime windows automatically. See `references/run-validation.md#nel-timeout-and-resume-behavior` for the full mechanism.

Implications for the agent:

- Do **not** lower `num_repeats`, split heavy tasks (AA-LCR, SciCode) into separate configs, or otherwise carve up the eval to fit inside 4h. Let NEL chain.
- Do **not** treat a walltime timeout as a failed run. Check `nel status` / `nel info` and the dependent job's logs before declaring failure. `references/run-validation.md` covers what a real failure looks like vs an expected resume event.
- Bumping `data_parallel_size` / `parallelism` to finish faster is fine when the goal is wall-clock latency, not a walltime workaround — but it's optional, not required, for runs longer than 4h.

---

### Step 5 — Confirm tasks (iterative)

1. Tell user: "Run `nel ls tasks` for the full task list."
2. For any task with a `recipes/tasks/` reference, read it and prefer its YAML fragment + repeat counts.
3. Ask about add/remove/modify. Per-task overrides under task's `nemo_evaluator_config.config.params`:

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: <task>
       nemo_evaluator_config:
         config:
           params:
             temperature: <value>
             ...
   ```

4. Apply, show updated list, ask "Final, or more changes?" Loop until confirmed.

**Tasks that call an external judge / user-simulator / scoring endpoint.** Treat this as a general pattern, not a fixed list — HLE, AA-LCR, and Tau2 need one today, but other benchmarks may too (check each task's recipe). Their `model_id` / `url` are **config, not secrets**: substitute the **literal** values the user keeps in `.env` (keys per the task's recipe + `recipes/env.example`) into the task's `<VAR>` placeholders. Do **not** emit `${oc.env:...}` for these (it silently fails unless the var was exported with `set -a`). Only `api_key` stays an env-var *name* (e.g. `INFERENCE_API_KEY`), exported and read by the harness.

**Known issue — nemo-skills self-deployment:** If using `nemo_skills.*` tasks (`ns_*`) with self-deployment (vLLM/SGLang/NIM), you need **both** of these:

```yaml
evaluation:
  env_vars:
    DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy   # MUST be set here — see below
  nemo_evaluator_config:
    target:
      api_endpoint:
        api_key_name: DUMMY_API_KEY
```

`api_key_name` only names the env var; the nemo-skills client **hard-fails if that var has no value inside the eval container** (`ValueError: api_key_env_var=DUMMY_API_KEY but the value is not set`). On SLURM, a shell `export DUMMY_API_KEY=dummy` (Step 8) does **NOT** propagate into the container — NEL only injects vars declared in `env_vars`. So declare `DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy` under `evaluation.env_vars` (note the `lit:` prefix — see below). The shell export only helps for local/Docker runs. External-deployment configs already define `api_key_name`.

**NEL env-var value prefixes (required):** every value in an `env_vars` map needs an explicit prefix — `host:VAR` (read from the submitting shell's env at submit time), `lit:value` (literal string), or `runtime:VAR` (read in the job at run time). A bare value (e.g. `DUMMY_API_KEY: dummy`) hard-errors: *"Env var value '…' must have an explicit prefix."* Use `lit:` for constants like `DUMMY_API_KEY` and `VLLM_*` backend selectors, `host:` for secrets like `HF_TOKEN` / `INFERENCE_API_KEY`.

---

### Step 6 — Multi-node

For models > ~120B or higher throughput needs, read `references/multi-node.md` for HAProxy multi-instance / Ray TP/PP / combined patterns.

### Step 7 — Interceptors

Direct user to <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/evaluator/latest/libraries/nemo-evaluator/interceptors/index.html>. Do not provide generic interceptor info — read the specific interceptor's page if asked, then configure via `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.target.api_endpoint.adapter_config` (`target` is a sibling of `config`, not nested under it). Use the per-field syntax from the CLI Configuration section, not a full `interceptors:` list (that overrides the default chain).

**Errata:** Logging field names are `max_logged_requests` / `max_logged_responses` (NOT `max_saved_*` / `max_*` as some docs show).

### Step 7.5 — Container registry auth (SLURM private images only)

Default images:

| Framework | Image | Registry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vLLM | `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.19.1` (bump per recipe; never `:latest`) | DockerHub |
| vLLM (NVFP4 on Blackwell) | `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.19.1-cu130` (bump to `cu130-nightly-<arch>` for new archs) | DockerHub |
| SGLang | `lmsysorg/sglang:latest` | DockerHub |
| TRT-LLM | `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/release:...` | NGC |
| Eval tasks | `nvcr.io/nvidia/eval-factory/*:26.03` | NGC |

> NVFP4 checkpoints on Blackwell (sm_100/sm_103) need the `cu130-nightly` image — cu129/v0.19.1 lack sm_103 FP4 kernels (see the "NVFP4 on Blackwell" note in Step 3).

Public images → submit without preflight. Private/restricted → check credentials:

```bash
ssh <host> "grep -E '^\s*machine\s+' ~/.config/enroot/.credentials 2>/dev/null"
```

Add credentials per `skills/common/slurm-setup.md` §6 if missing. If you can't add, switch to a compatible public image (e.g. `nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:<YY.MM>-py3` — check catalog.ngc.nvidia.com). **Do not retry more than once** after an auth failure.

---

### Step 8 — Run evaluation (gated dry-run → canary → full)

Run directly when the user asked to launch; otherwise ask before submitting.

**Env setup:** Copy `recipes/env.example` → `.env`, fill, source:

```bash
cp recipes/env.example .env
set -a && source .env && set +a

# If pre_cmd/post_cmd in config (review pre_cmd first — runs arbitrary commands):
export NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_PRE_CMD=1
# If nemo_skills.* + self-deployment, for LOCAL/Docker runs only:
export DUMMY_API_KEY=dummy
# On SLURM this shell export does NOT reach the container — instead declare
# `DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy` under evaluation.env_vars (see Step 5).
```

**Step 8.1 — Dry-run** (config validation):

```bash
nel run --config <path> --dry-run
```

Fix unresolved `???`, bad Hydra overrides, missing env vars, invalid mounts, image issues, sbatch errors, obvious deployment errors before proceeding.

**Step 8.2 — Canary** (limited-samples, validates everything dry-run can't):

```bash
nel run --config <path> -o ++evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=10
```

Catches judge auth/rate-limits, container failures, sandbox issues, OOM, bad request formatting, low evaluated counts. Always inspect logs:

```bash
nel status <id>
nel info <id> --logs
ssh <user>@<host> "grep -i 'traceback\|exception\|error\|failed\|oom\|killed\|timeout\|unauthorized\|rate limit\|sandbox\|container\|judge\|parse\|scoring' <log_path>/*.log"
```

Canary each risky task class separately (judge-scored, code-execution, model-only). Start `parallelism` conservatively; raise only after judge/sandbox logs are clean — they bottleneck before the model. For capacity-bound runs, tune `parallelism`/`--max-num-seqs` here against vLLM's reported max concurrency + preemption — see `references/parallelism.md`.

Single-task rerun: `nel run --config <path> -t <task_name>` (combine with `-o ++...limit_samples=10` for canary).

**Step 8.3 — Full run** (after canary passes):

```bash
nel run --config <path>
```

Remove `limit_samples` overrides; keep canary-validated parallelism. If the canary fails, fix and rerun the canary — don't skip to full.

**Monitoring:** Register the job per the **monitor** skill for cross-session tracking. One-off live status / debugging → **launching-evals** skill. Past-run MLflow queries → **accessing-mlflow** skill. NEL timeout/resume → read `references/run-validation.md` before treating the run as failed.

### Step 9 — Verify completed run

Before pulling/reporting scores, validate the run. Read `references/run-validation.md` for NEL timeout/resume behavior, completed-run validation, diagnostics, score harvesting, and the handoff to `compare-results` for baseline-vs-candidate deltas.
