Changelog
=========

0.45 (2026-06-xx)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Reorganize custom CUDA / Triton kernels under ``modelopt.torch.kernels`` into ``common/attention``, ``quantization/{conv,gemm}``, and ``sparsity/attention``. High-level APIs (``mtq.quantize``, ``mtsa.sparsify``, etc.) are unchanged, but **any code importing directly from the kernel subpackages must be updated**: there is no backwards-compatibility shim; the old import paths will raise ``ImportError`` / ``ModuleNotFoundError``. Migration table:

  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels import IS_AVAILABLE, attention, attention_calibrate, register_triton_attention`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.triton_fa import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.hf_triton_attention import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.hf_triton_attention import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.quantization.triton import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.quantization.gemm import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.quantization.src.conv.implicit_gemm_cuda import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.quantization.conv.implicit_gemm_cuda import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity.kernels import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.sparsity.attention import ...``

- Deprecated GradNAS pruning algorithm as it is not actively maintained and supports very limited and old models. It is recommended to use Minitron or Puzzletron pruning for LLM models. Also deprecates related ``examples/chained_optimizations`` directory.

- Model-specific PTQ ``quant_cfg`` adjustments previously hardcoded in ``examples/llm_ptq/`` (``build_quant_cfg`` / ``mono_quantize``) for gemma, mpt, phi4mm, and Nemotron VL are now opt-in **model-specific recipes** under ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/``. Any adjustment specific to a model type or instance must live in that model's recipe; the bare ``--qformat`` path produces only the generic numerics. Pass ``--recipe huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/<recipe>`` to apply the model's recipe. Covers gemma/mpt ``w4a8_awq`` (``awq_lite`` ``alpha_step=1``), gemma ``int8_sq`` (SmoothQuant ``alpha=0.5``), phi4mm speech/audio/image/vision exclusions, and Nemotron VL vision-branch exclusions. All shipped recipes also enable FP8 KV-cache cast. MTP dynamic layer exclusion and ``is_nemotron_vl`` detection remain in Python.

- The Step3.5-Flash recipe moved from ``modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml`` (0.44) to ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/step3p5/Step3.5-Flash/ptq/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml`` to match the ``huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/`` layout convention. Update ``--recipe`` paths accordingly.

**New Features**

- Extend Claude Code agent skills for PTQ, deployment, evaluation, monitoring, and baseline-vs-quantized result comparison. Adds evaluation task references for additional benchmarks, stronger PTQ checkpoint validation gates, and session-scoped workspace/job tracking.
- Add SLURM Quality of Service (QoS) support to the ModelOpt launcher. Users can set QoS via ``slurm_config.qos`` or ``SLURM_QOS`` and the value is forwarded to ``nemo_run.SlurmExecutor``.
- Add composable ``$import`` system for recipe YAML configs, enabling reusable config snippets referenced via ``{$import: name}`` markers. All built-in PTQ recipes converted to use imports with shared snippets under ``modelopt_recipes/configs/`` (numeric formats, quant_cfg building blocks, presets). See :ref:`composable-imports`.
- Add offline DFlash speculative decoding training. Train the draft module from pre-computed base-model hidden states dumped by ``examples/speculative_decoding/collect_hidden_states/compute_hidden_states_hf.py``; base-model transformer layers are deleted after conversion to save memory. Controlled by the auto-derived ``dflash_offline`` flag on ``DFlashConfig`` (derived from ``data_args.offline_data_path``). The dump scripts now share ``collect_hidden_states/common.py`` for aux-layer selection (``--aux-layers eagle|dflash|<list>``) and optional assistant-token ``loss_mask`` for answer-only-loss training.
- Add support for ``active_params`` (for MoE models) and ``memory_mb`` constraints in Minitron pruning on top of existing ``params`` constraint. You can also provide multiple constraints. See `examples/pruning/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning>`_ for more details. The underlying utility functions ``mcore_param_count``, ``mcore_memory_footprint_mb``, and ``print_mcore_model_stats`` in ``modelopt.torch.nas.plugins.megatron_model_stats`` are also available for standalone use to compute parameter counts and memory footprints (weights + KV-cache + Mamba state) for any Megatron-Core model.
- Add Minitron pruning support for Megatron-Bridge Gemma3 models.
- Add end-to-end tutorial for Minitron pruning + two-phase distillation (80B @ 8K + 20B @ 32K long-context = 100B tokens) + FP8 PTQ + vLLM deployment for Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16 (MoE + Mamba-Transformer hybrid) → Pruned 22B/A3.0B active params, along with data blend preparation steps (with tool-calling data) and detailed pruning / data-blend / long-context ablations. See `examples/pruning/minitron/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning/minitron/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16/>`_ for details.
- Add ``--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4`` flag to ``examples/llm_ptq/hf_ptq.py`` for closed-form, bit-exact MXFP4 → NVFP4 weight conversion. Supports the GPT-OSS family (``openai/gpt-oss-20b``, ``openai/gpt-oss-120b``). See `examples/llm_ptq/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq#mxfp4--nvfp4-cast-for-gpt-oss>`__ for usage.
- DeepSeek PTQ (``examples/deepseek/ptq.py``) now defaults to native top-k calibration with post-hoc per-layer peer-max sync of expert ``input_quantizer.amax``; the all-experts path is preserved behind ``--calib_all_experts``.
- Add NVFP4 W4A16 weight-only quantization (``w4a16_nvfp4``): FP4 weights with group_size=16, BF16 activations, no calibration forward pass required. Use ``mtq.W4A16_NVFP4_CFG`` or ``--qformat w4a16_nvfp4`` in ``hf_ptq.py``. vLLM deployment support is in progress.
- Add Megatron Core export/import mapping for Qwen3-VL (``Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration``) vision-language models. The mapping handles the ``model.language_model.`` weight prefix used by Qwen3-VL.
- Add active-MoE cost accounting for ``mtq.auto_quantize`` effective-bits search. Set ``constraints={"effective_bits": ..., "cost_model": "active_moe", "cost": {"active_moe_expert_ratio": ...}}`` to weight routed MoE expert costs by active experts per token while keeping shared experts fully counted. The ``hf_ptq.py`` AutoQuant path exposes this via ``--auto_quantize_cost_model active_moe`` and ``--auto_quantize_active_moe_expert_ratio``.
- Add ``DATASET_COMBOS`` to ``modelopt.torch.utils.dataset_utils`` — single ``--dataset`` tokens that fan out to multiple registered datasets; per-entry ``num_samples`` is split evenly across the members. Initial combos: ``cnn_nemotron_v2_mix`` (``cnn_dailymail`` + ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2``, used by ``hf_ptq.py`` when no ``--dataset`` is provided) and ``nemotron-post-training-v3`` (the seven ``nvidia/Nemotron-*`` SFT datasets added in #1498, mirroring the `nemotron-post-training-v3 collection <https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-post-training-v3>`_). Combo names are listed by ``get_supported_datasets()`` and surfaced in ``--dataset`` help. ``get_dataset_dataloader`` rejects inputs that mix a combo with one of its member datasets (e.g. ``cnn_dailymail,cnn_nemotron_v2_mix``) to avoid double-sampling, and ``get_dataset_samples`` rejects combo names so callers route through the dataloader. ``hf_ptq.py`` default ``--calib_size`` is bumped from ``512`` to ``1024`` so the total calibration sample count under the new default combo matches the previous two-dataset fallback.
- The ``nemotron-sft-agentic-v2`` registered dataset (added in #1498) now uses only the ``search`` split. The previously configured ``interactive_agent`` and ``tool_calling`` splits contain content-level defects (heterogeneous schema and a malformed JSON row, respectively) that cause pyarrow's streaming JSON reader to fail deterministically.
- Add shared Megatron-Core calibration forward loop: ``modelopt.torch.utils.plugins.megatron_calibration.get_megatron_calibration_forward_loop`` produces the ``forward_loop`` callable expected by ``mtq.quantize`` / ``mtp.prune``. Replaces the bespoke calibration loops in Megatron-LM and Megatron-Bridge for quantization and pruning with a single canonical implementation.
- Add ``pack=True`` mode to ``get_dataset_dataloader`` (Megatron-LM pretraining-style global-stream document packing): all raw samples concatenated EOS-separated into one token stream, sliced into uniform ``max_sample_length`` rows. Used by the shared megatron calibration loop.
- Support Megatron-Core checkpoint restore and export for MSE ``NVFP4StaticQuantizer``.
- Add mixed-precision FP8 + NVFP4 export for Megatron-Core: per-layer ``quant_algo`` recorded under ``quantized_layers`` in ``hf_quant_config.json``, PP-aware ``kv_cache_dtype`` gather, fused-QKV exclude split into per-HF-name ``q/k/v_proj`` entries.
- Add Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B PTQ recipes ``modelopt_recipes/models/Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B/super-nvfp4.yaml`` (MSE-mixed) and ``super-nvfp4-max-calib.yaml`` (max-calib mixed): NVFP4 W4A4 routed experts + FP8 per-tensor shared experts / Mamba in/out_proj + FP8 KV cache.
- Add quantized ``nn.Embedding`` support. ``nn.Embedding`` is now registered in ``QuantModuleRegistry`` and exposes ``weight_quantizer`` (embedding table), ``output_quantizer`` (lookup activations), and a permanently disabled ``input_quantizer`` placeholder — embedding inputs are integer indices and cannot be fake-quantized, so direct ``enable*()`` calls raise. ``export_hf_checkpoint`` packs quantized embedding weights alongside Linear layers. Embedding quantizers are opt-in (``parent_class: nn.Embedding`` disabled by default).
- Add post-training quantization (PTQ) example for the Megatron-Bridge framework: ``examples/megatron_bridge/quantize.py`` calibrates an HF model (via ``--quant_cfg`` alias / full config name or a ``--recipe`` YAML, with optional KV-cache quant, weight-only, compression, and MoE expert-ratio calibration) and saves a Megatron checkpoint (tensor / pipeline / expert parallelism supported), and ``examples/megatron_bridge/export.py`` converts that checkpoint to a deployable HuggingFace (unified) checkpoint for TensorRT-LLM / vLLM / SGLang. See `examples/megatron_bridge/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge>`_ for details.
- Refactor ``llm_qat`` example with unified YAML-based configuration and flexible dataset blending.
  ``ModelOptArgParser`` adds ``--config`` YAML support with CLI overrides and auto-generates ``ARGUMENTS.md`` from dataclass definitions.
  Dataset blending (``configs/dataset/blend.yaml``) supports HuggingFace datasets, local JSON/JSONL/Parquet files, and weighted multi-source blends.
  The legacy FSDP1 accelerate config is removed; ``llm_qat`` now documents FSDP2, DeepSpeed, and DDP backends.

**Bug Fixes**

- In Megatron-Core only do EP amax sync for routed expert weights if ``sync_expert_weight_amax=True``. Previously EP amax sync would sync routed expert weights across EP ranks even when ``sync_expert_weight_amax`` was False.
- Fix Megatron-Core HF importer to load fused ``TELayerNormColumnParallelLinear.layer_norm_weight`` from HF for GPT-family models (Qwen3 etc.) under ``--export-default-te-spec``. Importer now prefers per-context keys ``fused_input_layernorm`` / ``fused_pre_mlp_layernorm`` (fallback ``fused_norm`` for Nemotron-H backward compatibility); ``mcore_qwen.py`` provides the new rules. Without this fix, post-prune MMLU sat at chance.
- Fix ONNX AutoCast ``keep_io_types=True`` sanity-check failure (``Unexpected type in I/O tensor ...``) when a network input/output is an empty tensor (a dimension of size 0). Such tensors were "fake-cast" (retyped in place) to the low precision type; because the value-info map aliases the ``graph.input``/``graph.output`` ``ValueInfoProto``, this silently changed the model's I/O type. AutoCast now inserts a real ``Cast`` for protected I/O tensors instead.

**Deprecations**

- Deprecate the public ``QuantizationArgumentsWithConfig`` name in ``modelopt.torch.quantization.plugins.transformers_trainer``; it now aliases ``QuantizationArguments`` and will be removed in a future release.

0.44 (2026-05-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New Features**

- Add model-agnostic `Liger kernel <https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel>`_ fused loss support in ``ModelOptHFTrainer`` for any HuggingFace causal LM, with distributed param gathering for FSDP2, DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, and DDP. Extends HuggingFace's built-in Liger integration which is limited to `a fixed set of model architectures <https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel/blob/main/src/liger_kernel/transformers/monkey_patch.py>`_, FSDP only, and CrossEntropy loss. ModelOpt additionally supports Liger fused KD loss (JSD) for knowledge distillation.
- Add ``ModelOptTrainerArguments`` to ``ModelOptHFTrainer`` with ``--trainable_params``, ``--frozen_params``, ``--lr_config``, ``--save_dtype``, and ``--manual_gc`` flags. Add per-parameter learning rate support via YAML config.
- Simplify ``KDTrainer`` for HuggingFace knowledge distillation: remove ``mtd.convert()`` class-swap in favor of explicit teacher forwarding with logit-level distillation support.
- Support full Transformer Engine spec for Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``). Now we no longer need to use custom ModelOpt spec. Note that this does not affect the usage of the pruning workflow but makes pruning slightly faster and may result in slightly different pruned model because of different kernel and numerics.
- Add end-to-end tutorial for Minitron pruning + distillation + quantization + evaluation + vLLM deployment for Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 → Pruned 7B along with data blend preparation steps (and ablation study). See `examples/pruning/minitron/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning/minitron/>`_ for details.
- Add Puzzletron - a new algorithm for heterogeneous pruning of LLM and VLM models. See `examples/puzzletron/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/puzzletron>`_ for more details.
- Added iterator interface using CalibrationDataReader in ONNX quantization workflow.
- Add N:M sparse softmax support to the Triton flash attention kernel (``modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa``). See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add skip-softmax skipping to the Triton flash attention kernel (``modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa``). See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add Video Sparse Attention (VSA) method for video diffusion models (``modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity``). VSA uses 3D block tiling with a two-branch architecture for attention speedup.
- Enable PTQ workflow for the Step3.5-Flash MoE model with NVFP4 W4A4 + FP8 KV cache quantization. See `modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml>`_ for more details.
- Add support for vLLM fakequant reload using ModelOpt state for HF models. See `examples/vllm_serve/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/vllm_serve#load-qatptq-model-and-serve-in-vllm-wip>`_ for more details.
- [Early Testing] Add Claude Code PTQ skill (``.claude/skills/ptq/``) for agent-assisted post-training quantization. The skill guides the agent through environment detection, model support checking, format selection, and execution via the launcher or manual SLURM/Docker/bare GPU paths. Includes handling for unlisted models with custom module patching. This feature is in early testing — use with caution.
- [Early Testing] Polish Claude Code evaluation skill (``.claude/skills/evaluation/``) for agent-assisted LLM accuracy benchmarking via NeMo Evaluator Launcher. Adds two companion skills vendored verbatim from `NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator <https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator>`_: ``launching-evals`` (run/check/debug/analyze NEL evaluations) and ``accessing-mlflow`` (query MLflow runs, compare metrics, fetch artifacts). Re-sync at a pinned upstream SHA via ``.claude/scripts/sync-upstream-skills.sh``. Also adds a shared ``skills/common/credentials.md`` covering HF / NGC / Docker token setup referenced by multiple skills. This feature is in early testing — use with caution.
- Add performant layerwise calibration for large models that don't fit on GPU (e.g. DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K2). See `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_experts_only-kv_fp8_layerwise.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_experts_only-kv_fp8_layerwise.yaml>`_ for usage. Layerwise calibration also supports PTQ with intermediate progress saving — useful when long PTQ runs get hit with Slurm timeouts. See `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_default-kv_none-gptq.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_default-kv_none-gptq.yaml>`_ for usage.
- Add implicit GEMM CUDA kernel for Conv3D with fused NVFP4 fake quantization (``modelopt.torch.quantization.src.conv``). When NVFP4 quantization is applied to an ``nn.Conv3d`` layer via ModelOpt PTQ, the implicit GEMM path is used automatically instead of cuDNN. Uses BF16 WMMA tensor cores (SM80+) with FP32 accumulation and in-kernel FP4 (E2M1) activation quantization. Grouped convolution (``groups > 1``) falls back to the default cuDNN path. Inference only — training mode falls back to cuDNN with a warning.
- Add FP8 MHA quantization support for vision transformers. Adds an attention-aware ONNX post-processing pass (scale Mul / K-transpose move before Q, Q→DQ insertion on softmax output) in :class:`FP8QuantExporter <modelopt.onnx.export.fp8_exporter.FP8QuantExporter>`, per-instance nested-attention-wrapper skipping in the HF plugin, and ``nn.LayerNorm`` registration in ``QuantModuleRegistry`` so BMM input quantizers and LayerNorm output quantizers defined in FP8_DEFAULT_CFG are honored end-to-end. See `examples/torch_onnx/torch_quant_to_onnx.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/torch_onnx/torch_quant_to_onnx.py>`_ for the general timm-model quantize→ONNX workflow.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- The ``quant_cfg`` field in quantization configs is now an **ordered list** of ``QuantizerCfgEntry`` dicts instead of a flat dictionary. Each entry specifies a ``quantizer_name`` wildcard, an optional ``parent_class`` filter, a ``cfg`` dict of quantizer attributes, and/or an ``enable`` flag. Entries are applied in list order with later entries overriding earlier ones. The old dict-based format is still accepted and automatically converted via ``normalize_quant_cfg_list()``, but now emits a ``DeprecationWarning``; new code should use the list format. All built-in configs (e.g. ``FP8_DEFAULT_CFG``, ``INT4_AWQ_CFG``, ``NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG``), examples, and YAML recipes have been updated. See the :ref:`quant-cfg` documentation for the new format reference and migration guide.
- Deprecated Mllama (Llama 3.2 Vision) support in the ``llm_ptq`` and ``vlm_ptq`` examples. The ``model_type == "mllama"`` branches and ``MllamaImageProcessor`` usage have been removed from ``hf_ptq.py`` and ``example_utils.py``. For image-text calibration of VLMs, use ``--calib_with_images`` with a supported VLM (see Nemotron VL section in ``examples/llm_ptq/README.md``).

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix Megatron utility functions for generation (with pipeline parallelism) and ~10x speedup in MMLU score evaluation (by batching prefill passes).
- Fix Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``) for MoE models. Importance estimation hooks were incorrectly registered for MoE modules and NAS step was hanging before this.
- Fix TRT support for remote autotuning in ONNX Autotune from 10.16+ to 10.15+ and fix TRT versioning check to the ``trtexec`` version instead of the TRT Python API when using ``trtexec`` backend.
- Exclude MatMul/Gemm nodes with K or N < 16 from ONNX INT8 and FP8 quantization. Such small-dimension GEMMs cannot efficiently use INT8/FP8 Tensor Cores and the added Q/DQ layers cause perf regressions in TensorRT. Honors Gemm ``transB`` when deriving K.
- Fix ``nvfp4_awq`` export ``AssertionError: Modules have different quantization formats`` for MoE models (e.g. Qwen3-30B-A3B) when some experts are not exercised by the calibration data. ``awq_lite`` now applies a neutral all-ones ``pre_quant_scale`` to any expert that ends up disabled (no cache-pass tokens, NaN scales, or no search-pass tokens) so its format remains ``nvfp4_awq``, consistent with the rest of the MoE block. A warning is emitted whenever this fallback fires.

**Misc**

- [Security] Changed the default of ``weights_only`` to ``True`` in ``torch.load`` for secure checkpoint loading. If you need to load a checkpoint that requires unpickling arbitrary objects, first register the class in ``torch.serialization.add_safe_globals([cls])`` before loading. Added :meth:`safe_save <modelopt.torch.utils.serialization.safe_save>` and :meth:`safe_load <modelopt.torch.utils.serialization.safe_load>` API to save and load checkpoints securely.
- Bump minimum required PyTorch version to 2.8.
- [Experimental] Add support for transformers>=5.0, including generic PTQ and unified HF checkpoint export for fused MoE expert modules (Mixtral, Qwen2-MoE, Qwen3-MoE, Qwen3.5-MoE, DeepSeek-V3, Jamba, OLMoE, etc.).
- Improve ``megatron_preprocess_data``: add ``--reasoning_content`` support for Nemotron v3 datasets, eliminate intermediate JSONL for HuggingFace datasets, return output file prefixes from the Python API, add gzip input support (``.jsonl.gz``), add ``--strip_newlines`` flag for plain-text pretraining data, add ``--hf_streaming`` for very large datasets (only consumed rows downloaded), and auto-shuffle when ``--hf_max_samples_per_split`` is set to avoid biased sampling.
- Add installation support for Python 3.14. Only basic unit tests are verified for now. Production usage still defaults to Python 3.12. Python 3.10 support will be dropped in the next release.

0.43 (2026-04-16)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Bug Fixes**

- ONNX Runtime dependency upgraded to 1.24 to solve missing graph outputs when using the TensorRT Execution Provider.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Default ``--kv_cache_qformat`` in ``hf_ptq.py`` changed from ``fp8`` to ``fp8_cast``. Existing scripts that rely on the default will now skip KV cache calibration and use a constant amax instead. To restore the previous calibrated behavior, explicitly pass ``--kv_cache_qformat fp8``.
- Removed KV cache scale clamping (``clamp_(min=1.0)``) in the HF checkpoint export path. Calibrated KV cache scales below 1.0 are now exported as-is. If you observe accuracy degradation with calibrated KV cache (``--kv_cache_qformat fp8`` or ``nvfp4``), consider using the casting methods (``fp8_cast`` or ``nvfp4_cast``) instead.

**New Features**

- Add ``fp8_cast`` and ``nvfp4_cast`` modes for ``--kv_cache_qformat`` in ``hf_ptq.py``. These use a constant amax (FP8 E4M3 max, 448.0) without data-driven calibration, since the downstream engine uses FP8 attention math for both FP8 and NVFP4 quantization. A new ``use_constant_amax`` field in :class:`QuantizerAttributeConfig <modelopt.torch.quantization.config.QuantizerAttributeConfig>` controls this behavior.
- User does not need to manually register MOE modules to cover experts calibration coverage in PTQ workflow.
- ``hf_ptq.py`` now saves the quantization summary and moe expert token count table to the export directory.
- Add ``--moe_calib_experts_ratio`` flag in ``hf_ptq.py`` to specify the ratio of experts to calibrate during forward pass to improve expert coverage during calibration. Default to None (not enabled).
- Add sparse attention optimization for transformer models (``modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity``). This reduces computational cost by skipping attention computation. Supports calibration for threshold selection on HuggingFace models. See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add support for rotating the input before quantization for RHT.
- Add support for advanced weight scale search for NVFP4 quantization and its export path.
- Enable PTQ workflow for Qwen3.5 MoE models.
- Enable PTQ workflow for the Kimi-K2.5 model.
- Add ``nvfp4_omlp_only`` quantization format for NVFP4 quantization. This is similar to ``nvfp4_mlp_only`` but also quantizes the output projection layer in attention.
- Add ``nvfp4_experts_only`` quantization config that targets only MoE routed expert layers (excluding shared) with NVFP4 quantization.
- ``pass_through_bwd`` in the quantization config is now default to True. Please set it to False if you want to use STE with zeroed outlier gradients for potentially better QAT accuracy.
- Add :meth:`compute_quantization_mse <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.compute_quantization_mse>` API to measure per-quantizer mean-squared quantization error, with flexible wildcard and callable filtering.
- **Autotune**: New tool for automated Q/DQ (Quantize/Dequantize) placement optimization for ONNX models. Uses TensorRT latency measurements to choose insertion schemes that minimize inference time. Discovers regions automatically, groups them by structural pattern, and tests multiple Q/DQ schemes per pattern. Supports INT8 and FP8 quantization, pattern cache for warm-start on similar models, checkpoint/resume, and importing patterns from an existing QDQ baseline. CLI: ``python -m modelopt.onnx.quantization.autotune``. See the Autotune guide in the documentation.
- Add ``get_auto_quantize_config`` API to extract a flat quantization config from ``auto_quantize`` search results, enabling re-quantization at different effective bit targets without re-running calibration.
- Improve ``auto_quantize`` checkpoint/resume: calibration state is now saved and restored across runs, avoiding redundant calibration when resuming a search.
- Add support for Nemotron-3 (NemotronHForCausalLM) model quantization and support for NemotronH MoE expert support in ``auto_quantize`` grouping and scoring rules.
- Add support for block-granular RHT for non-power-of-2 dimensions.
- Replace modelopt FP8 QDQ nodes with native ONNX QDQ nodes.

**Deprecations**

- Removed MT-Bench (FastChat) support from ``examples/llm_eval``. The ``run_fastchat.sh`` and ``gen_model_answer.py`` scripts have been deleted, and the ``mtbench`` task has been removed from the ``llm_ptq`` example scripts.
- Remove deprecated NeMo-2.0 Framework references.

**Misc**

- Migrated project metadata from ``setup.py`` to a fully declarative ``pyproject.toml``.
- Enable experimental Python 3.13 wheel support and unit tests in CI/CD.

0.42 (2026-03-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix calibration data generation with multiple samples in the ONNX workflow.

**New Features**

- Add standalone type inference option (``--use_standalone_type_inference``) in ONNX AutoCast as an alternative to ONNX's ``infer_shapes``. This experimental feature performs type-only inference without shape inference, useful as a workaround when shape inference fails or to avoid unnecessary shape inference overhead.
- Add support for Kimi K2 Thinking model quantization from the original int4 checkpoint.
- Add support for ``params`` constraint based automatic neural architecture search in Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``) as an alternative to manual pruning (using ``export_config``). See `examples/pruning/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning>`_ for more details on its usage.
- New example for Minitron pruning with Megatron-Bridge framework along with advanced pruning usage with new ``params`` constraint based pruning. Also add example for distillation with Megatron-Bridge framework. Check `examples/megatron_bridge/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge>`_ for example scripts.
- Add support for calibration data with multiple samples in ``npz`` format in the ONNX Autocast workflow.
- Add ``--opset`` option to ONNX quantization CLI to specify the target opset version for the quantized model.
- Add support for context parallelism in Eagle speculative decoding for huggingface and megatron core models.

0.31 (2025-06-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- NeMo and Megatron-LM distributed checkpoint (``torch-dist``) stored with legacy version can no longer be loaded. The remedy is to load the legacy distributed checkpoint with 0.29 and store a ``torch`` checkpoint and resume with 0.31 to convert to a new format. The following changes only apply to storing and resuming distributed checkpoint.
    - ``quantizer_state`` of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` is now stored in ``extra_state`` of :class:`QuantModule <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.module.QuantModule>` where it used to be stored in the sharded ``modelopt_state``.
    - The dtype and shape of ``amax`` and ``pre_quant_scale`` stored in the distributed checkpoint are now restored. Some dtype and shape are previously changed to make all decoder layers to have homogeneous structure in the checkpoint.
    - Together with megatron.core-0.13, quantized model will store and resume distributed checkpoint in a heterogenous format.
- auto_quantize API now accepts a list of quantization config dicts as the list of quantization choices.
    - This API previously accepts a list of strings of quantization format names. It was therefore limited to only pre-defined quantization formats unless through some hacks.
    - With this change, now user can easily use their own custom quantization formats for auto_quantize.
    - In addition, the ``quantization_formats`` now exclude ``None`` (indicating "do not quantize") as a valid format because the auto_quantize internally always add "do not quantize" as an option anyway.
- Model export config is refactored. The quant config in ``hf_quant_config.json`` is converted and saved to ``config.json``. ``hf_quant_config.json`` will be deprecated soon.


**Deprecations**

- :meth:`modelopt.torch.utils.dataset_utils.get_dataset_dataloader` now returns a key value pair instead of the tensor.

**New Features**

- New APIs and examples: :mod:`modelopt.torch.prune` for pruning Conv, Linear, and Attention heads for
  NVIDIA Megatron-core GPT-style models (e.g. Llama 3), PyTorch Computer Vision models, and HuggingFace Bert/GPT-J models.
- New API: :mod:`modelopt.torch.distill` for knowledge distillation, along with guides and example.
- New Example: HF BERT Prune, Distill & Quantize
  showcasing how to chain pruning, distillation, and quantization to achieve the best performance on a given model.
- Added INT8/FP8 DQ-only support for ONNX model.
- New API: :mod:`modelopt.torch.speculative` for end-to-end support of Medusa models.
- Added Medusa QAT and End-to-end examples.
- Modelopt now supports automatic save/restore of ``modelopt_state`` with the ``.save_pretrained`` and ``.from_pretrained`` APIs
  from Huggingface libraries, such as ``transformers`` and ``diffusers``. This feature can be enabled by calling
  :meth:`mto.enable_huggingface_checkpointing() <modelopt.torch.opt.plugins.huggingface.enable_huggingface_checkpointing>`.
- ONNX FP8 quantization support with amax calibration.
- TensorRT-LLM dependency upgraded to 0.12.0. Huggingface tokenizer files are now also stored in the engine dir.
- The unified model export API :meth:`modelopt.torch.export.export_hf_checkpoint <modelopt.torch.export.unified_export_hf.export_hf_checkpoint>`
  supports exporting ``fp8`` and ``int4_awq`` quantized checkpoints with packed weights for
  Hugging Face models with namings aligned with its original checkpoints. The exported ``fp8`` checkpoints can be deployed with both TensorRT-LLM and VLLM.
- Add int8 and fp8 quantization support for the FLUX.1-dev model.
- Add a Python-friendly TensorRT inference pipeline for diffusion models.

**Misc**

- Added deprecation warning for :meth:`set_data_parallel_group <modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_data_parallel_group>`
  and :meth:`set_tensor_parallel_group <modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_tensor_parallel_group>`. These APIs are
  no longer needed for supporting distributed data and tensor parallelism in quantization. They will be removed in
  a future release.


0.15 (2024-07-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Deprecated :class:`QuantDescriptor <modelopt.torch.quantization.tensor_quant.QuantDescriptor>`.
  Use :class:`QuantizerAttributeConfig <modelopt.torch.quantization.config.QuantizerAttributeConfig>` to
  configure :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>`.
  :meth:`set_from_attribute_config <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer.set_from_attribute_config>`
  can be used to set the quantizer attributes from the config class or attribute dictionary. This change applies only
  to backend APIs. The change is backward compatible if you are using
  only the :meth:`mtq.quantize <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.quantize>` API.

**New Features**

- Added quantization support for torch ``RNN, LSTM, GRU`` modules. Only available for ``torch>=2.0``.
- ``modelopt.torch.quantization`` now supports module class based quantizer attribute setting for
  :meth:`mtq.quantize <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.quantize>` API.
- Added new LLM PTQ example for DBRX model.
- Added new LLM (Gemma 2) PTQ and TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export support.
- Added new LLM QAT example for NVIDIA NeMo framework.
- TensorRT-LLM dependency upgraded to 0.11.0.
- (Experimental): :meth:`mtq.auto_quantize <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.auto_quantize>` API which quantizes a model
  by searching for the best per-layer quantization formats.
- (Experimental): Added new LLM QLoRA example with NF4 and INT4_AWQ quantization.
- (Experimental): ``modelopt.torch.export`` now supports exporting quantized checkpoints with packed weights for
  Hugging Face models with namings aligned with its original checkpoints.
- (Experimental) Added support for quantization of ONNX models with TensorRT plugin.

**Misc**

- Added deprecation warning for ``torch<2.0``. Support will be dropped in next release.


0.13 (2024-06-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- `PTQ examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq>`_ have been
  upgraded to use TensorRT-LLM 0.10.

**New Features**

- Adding TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export support for Medusa decoding (official ``MedusaModel`` and Megatron Core ``GPTModel``).
- Enable support for mixtral, recurrentgemma, starcoder, qwen in `PTQ examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq>`_.
- Adding TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export and engine building support for sparse models.
- Import scales from TensorRT calibration cache and use them for quantization.
- (Experimental) Enable low GPU memory FP8 calibration for the Hugging Face models when the original model size does not fit into the GPU memory.
- (Experimental) Support exporting FP8 calibrated model to VLLM deployment.
- (Experimental) Python 3.12 support added.


0.11 (2024-05-07)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- [!!!] The package was renamed from ``ammo`` to ``modelopt``. The new full product
  name is *Nvidia Model Optimizer*. PLEASE CHANGE ALL YOUR REFERENCES FROM ``ammo`` to
  ``modelopt`` including any paths and links!
- Default installation ``pip install nvidia-modelopt`` will now only install minimal core
  dependencies. Following optional dependencies are available depending on the features that are
  being used: ``[deploy], [onnx], [torch], [hf]``. To install all dependencies, use
  ``pip install "nvidia-modelopt[all]"``.
- Deprecated ``inference_gpus`` arg in ``modelopt.torch.export.model_config_export.torch_to_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint``. User should use ``inference_tensor_parallel`` instead.
- Experimental ``modelopt.torch.deploy`` module is now available as ``modelopt.torch._deploy``.

**New Features**

- ``modelopt.torch.sparsity`` now supports sparsity-aware training (SAT). Both SAT and post-training
  sparsification supports chaining with other modes, e.g. SAT + QAT.
- ``modelopt.torch.quantization`` natively support distributed data and tensor parallelism while estimating quantization parameters.
  The data and tensor parallel groups needs to be registered with ``modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_data_parallel_group`` and ``modelopt.torch.utils.distributed.set_tensor_parallel_group`` APIs.
  By default, the data parallel group is set as the default distributed group and the tensor parallel group is disabled.
- ``modelopt.torch.opt`` now supports chaining multiple optimization techniques that each require
  modifications to the same model, e.g., you can now sparsify and quantize a model at the same time.
- ``modelopt.onnx.quantization`` supports FLOAT8 quantization format with Distribution calibration algorithm.
- Native support of ``modelopt.torch.opt`` with FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) for ``torch>=2.1``. This includes
  sparsity, quantization, and any other model modification & optimization.
- Added FP8 ONNX quantization support in ``modelopt.onnx.quantization``.
- Added Windows (``win_amd64``) support for ModelOpt released wheels. Currently supported for ``modelopt.onnx`` submodule only.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed the compatibility issue of ``modelopt.torch.sparsity`` with FSDP.
- Fixed an issue in dynamic dim handling in ``modelopt.onnx.quantization`` with random calibration data.
- Fixed graph node naming issue after opset conversion operation.
- Fixed an issue in negative dim handling like dynamic dim in ``modelopt.onnx.quantization`` with random calibration data.
- Fixed allowing to accept ``.pb`` file for input file.
- Fixed copy extra data to tmp folder issue for ONNX PTQ.
